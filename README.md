# This is a web app created in Spring + Angular
# Here I have a simple product web app . It lists all the available products , Ive also used a DataInitializer(that generates 20 products using a for cycle )
# Its not connected to a database , it uses h2
# Ive also added a form , that when you click add , it add the product to the list and each product has a Edit and delete button , which are fully functional
# Ive also added pagination , so that you can see multiple products in multiple pages
# There is also a search filter , which enables you to search through the products using a name
# Used bootstrap for the looks
# Currently looking for more features and ideas to add.
